# codebar-practice
Frontend exercises from Codebar's Web Foundations Course. Customised to solidify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

# Codebar Dash Projects

A collection of frontend development projects completed through Codebar's curriculum using [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) curriculum. I am customising each project's codebase to test my understanding and develop additional skills. 

## About This Repository

Alongside studying Codebar's Web Development Foundations course, I am using these projects to:
- Consolidate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- Improve version control and project organisation
- Practice adapting preexisting codebases

**Original exercises from Codebar/Dash** - I am modifying styling, added features, and expanded functionality to make each project my own - but I am working from code exercises from Dash.

## Projects

## Acknowledgments

Original exercises from [Codebar Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) - a great resource for learning web development fundamentals through immediate application of knowledge.

💼  As I learn, I am exploring multiple areas, including full stack development, cybersecurity, testing, accessible design, and technical writing. (I believe it is important to develop an understanding of how your work interacts and intersects with other people's - and I find it all interesting!)

I am open to work opportunities in any of these areas.
